# SortingVisualizer
A C# Software that allows you to visualize Sorting Algorithms

It visualizes 3 sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- QuickSort

Features:
- Adjusting array size to order in real time.
- Randomizing button to reset the array.
- Dynamic resize of visualization.

One of my first projects in C# to learn it.

In the future it might be updated with better code and more sorting algorithms.
